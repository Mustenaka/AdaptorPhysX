# AdaptorPhysX

The main purpose of AdaptorPhysX is to try to use PBD (position based dynamics) algorithm to simulate a deformable object with volume or surface, and implement a calculation framework according to PBD calculation rules.
PBD algorithm is more used in non-rigid fabric algorithm, so I decided to try this algorithm applied to the settlement of flexible body.
The project is still in its early stages.
